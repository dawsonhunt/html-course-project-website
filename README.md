# Final Project - HTML Course by David Gray through FreeCodeCamp
This repository contains the HTML and other files for my submission of the final project from FreeCodeCamp's HTML course with David Gray. The pictures and website screenshots come from the [project starter files](https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course/tree/main/10_lesson_starter), while the HTML was written by me in an attempt to replicate the website seen in the screenshots. The project covered most of the HTML aspects that websites require, including page meta information; figures, images, and captions; text objects like headings, strong text, lists, and links; and also more specialized website features like tables and forms. I greatly enjoyed completing this project and I can't wait to learn more Web Development. Perhaps I will return to this project once I have learned more advanced Web Development and spice up this taco stand a little ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ® :)

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions, or to raise an issue if there's some feature you'd like to see put in. Thanks for checking out my repo!
